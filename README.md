## (2) Abstract:
Human action recognition techniques have gained significant attention among next-generation technologies due to their specific features and high capability to inspect video sequences to understand human actions. As a result, many fields have benefited from human action recognition techniques. Deep learning techniques played a primary role in many approaches to human action recognition. The new era of learning is spreading by transfer learning. Accordingly, this studyâ€™s main objective is to propose a framework with three main phases for human action recognition. The phases are pre-training, preprocessing, and recognition. This framework presents a set of novel techniques that are three-fold as follows, (i) in the pre-training phase, a standard convolutional neural network is trained on a generic dataset to adjust weights; (ii) to perform the recognition process, this pre-trained model is then applied to the target dataset; and (iii) the recognition phase exploits convolutional neural network and long short-term memory to apply five different architectures. Three architectures are stand-alone and single-stream, while the other two are combinations between the first three in two-stream style. Experimental results show that the first three architectures recorded accuracies of 83.24%, 90.72%, and 90.85%, respectively. The last two architectures achieved accuracies of 93.48% and 94.87%, respectively. Moreover, The recorded results outperform other state-of-the-art models in the same field.
